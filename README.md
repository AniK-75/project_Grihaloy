## 🌆 Overview

**Grihaloy** is an advanced **web-based rental management platform** crafted for the modern Bangladeshi housing ecosystem.  
It acts as a **digital bridge** between **landlords and renters**, automating the process of renting, verification, and property communication — replacing traditional, time-consuming manual methods with an intelligent, data-driven, and secure approach.

Built using **Django (Python)** as the backend framework and **Bootstrap 5** for the frontend, Grihaloy is designed to be **scalable, responsive, and easy to use**.  
The system provides role-based dashboards, allowing **Admins**, **Landlords**, and **Renters** to seamlessly interact within a unified digital environment.

> ⚙️ Grihaloy’s ultimate goal is to modernize the real estate rental industry of Bangladesh through **automation, transparency, and digital transformation**.

## 🧭 Core Vision

> To revolutionize the traditional renting system in Bangladesh by introducing a **secure, intelligent, and fully digitalized** solution — empowering property owners and renters with technology that fosters **trust, speed, and efficiency**.

### 🎯 Problem It Solves

Traditional renting in Bangladesh is often:
- Manual and time-consuming  
- Lacking document verification systems  
- Non-transparent in pricing and agreements  
- Hard to manage multiple property listings or tenant communications  

**Grihaloy** eliminates these issues by offering:
- Centralized **user verification and data storage**
- Built-in **heatmap analytics** for rental prices
- **Automated approval workflows** for property requests
- Future modules for **digital rent payment and smart notifications**

## 🧠 Broad Description

At its heart, **Grihaloy** is a **multi-role platform** with a layered architecture that ensures data separation, performance, and scalability.  

### 💼 Landlords
Landlords can register properties, upload images, set rental prices, and verify renters through a secure digital channel.  
They get a dedicated dashboard to manage properties, view requests, and communicate directly with potential tenants.

### 👥 Renters
Renters can browse listings, send rental requests, upload identification documents, and track verification progress — all in one place.  
They can also view rental price insights using the **heatmap service**, helping them make better housing decisions.

### 🧑‍💼 Admins
Admins maintain full control of the platform — approving new users, verifying identities, managing reports, and monitoring system activity.

Together, these three roles create a **secure ecosystem** that makes renting faster, smarter, and safer.
